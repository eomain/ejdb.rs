/// This structure is a transaction guard for an EJDB collection. It employs the RAII pattern:
/// a value of this structure is returned when a transaction is started and when this value
/// is dropped, the transaction is committed or aborted.
///
/// By default when a transaction goes out of scope, it is aborted. This is done because
/// of the way how errors are handled in Rust: if you interleave working with an EJDB collection
/// with other, potentially failing operations, then it is possible for an error to cause
/// an early return, dropping the transaction in progress. In this case aborting the transaction
/// is usually the most natural option.
///
/// However, it is possible to change the default behavior with `set_commit()/set_abort()` methods,
/// and it is also possible to commit or abort the transaction with `commit()`/`abort()` methods.
/// `finish()` method is essentially equivalent to dropping the transaction guard, except that
/// it returns a value which may contain an error (for regular drops any errors are ignored).
/// `will_commit()`/`will_abort()` methods return `true` if their respective action will be taken
/// upon finishing.
///
/// In EJDB transactions can only span one collection, therefore transactions created from a
/// collection has a direct lifetime dependency on it.
///
/// See `Collection::begin_transaction()` documentation for examples.
